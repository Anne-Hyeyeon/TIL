## White Box Testing And Black Box Testing
White Box Testing and Black Box Testing are two commonly used testing techniques in software development. They differ in terms of the level of knowledge about the internal workings of the system being tested.

### White Box Testing
White Box Testing, also known as Clear Box Testing or Structural Testing, is a testing approach where the tester has access to the internal structure, code, and implementation details of the software system. The purpose of White Box Testing is to evaluate the internal logic and flow of the system, as well as to ensure that all code paths are properly executed and tested. Test cases are designed based on the internal structure of the software.
Example:
Let's say you are testing a function that calculates the square root of a number. In White Box Testing, you would have knowledge of the code implementation of the function. You would design test cases that cover different code paths, such as testing with positive numbers, negative numbers, zero, and invalid input. You might also include test cases to ensure the function handles edge cases correctly, such as very large or very small numbers.

### Black Box Testing
Black Box Testing is a testing approach where the tester does not have access to the internal structure, code, or implementation details of the software system. The tester focuses solely on the inputs and outputs of the system, without any knowledge of its internal workings. Black Box Testing aims to evaluate the system's behavior and functionality based on its specifications, requirements, and expected outputs.
Example:
Let's consider testing a login functionality of a website. In Black Box Testing, you would only have access to the user interface and specifications. You would design test cases based on the expected behavior of the login feature, such as verifying if valid usernames and passwords are accepted, checking for error messages with invalid inputs, testing password reset functionality, and ensuring proper redirection after successful login. You would not have knowledge of the code implementation or the internal workings of the authentication process.

Both White Box Testing and Black Box Testing have their advantages and are used in different scenarios. White Box Testing is useful for thorough code coverage and identifying internal defects, while Black Box Testing focuses on validating the system's functionality from an end-user perspective. Often, a combination of both techniques is employed to achieve comprehensive test coverage.
