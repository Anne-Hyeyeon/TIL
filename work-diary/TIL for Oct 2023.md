## Handling Undefined Data Errors in Frontend Applications
### Problem
1. Error report received from the QA team stating the main screen of a specific server isn't displaying.
2. Upon checking, a particular value on a specific page is coming in as undefined.
3. This value is being sourced from the redux store using `useSelector`.

**Question: Even if the backend does not send the data, what measures can be taken on the front end to prevent errors due to undefined?**


### Solution:

- **Data Validation**:
    - Check the validity of the data received from the backend.
    - For instance, verify if a particular key exists in an object, if an array is empty, or if a value is null or undefined.
- **Setting Default Values**:
    - Define default values to be used in the absence of data to prevent errors.
- **Use Optional Chaining (`?.`)**:
    - In JavaScript, safely access nested properties of an object using the `?.` operator.
    - Example: `const value = data?.user?.name;`
- **Utilize Nullish Coalescing (`??`)**:
    - Use the `??` operator to substitute null or undefined values with another value.
    - Example: `const value = data.user.name ?? 'Default Name';`
- **Employ React Error Boundaries**:
    - Use Error Boundaries in React to catch errors in a component tree and render a fallback UI.
    - This ensures only the error-prone component gets replaced while the rest of the application continues to function.
- **Manage Loading State**:
    - Handle a loading state while fetching data from the backend. If data isn't ready, display a spinner or placeholder.
- **Error Handling**:
    - When using APIs like Axios or Fetch, capture errors from API calls using .catch() or try/catch blocks.
    - In case of an error, display an error message to the user or implement retry logic.
- **Adopt TypeScript**:
    - Using TypeScript can help catch type-related errors at compile-time, reducing runtime errors.
- **Automate Testing**:
    - Write tests for components and functions using tools like Jest or React Testing Library. This ensures code can be safely deployed with every change.
