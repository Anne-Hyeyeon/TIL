## What is difference between attr and property in HTML?
### attribute
- An "attribute" (or "attr") is a piece of information that is **added to an HTML tag to define its properties.** 
- Attributes are used to provide additional information about an element, such as its color, size, or behavior. 
- Attributes can be defined in the opening tag of an element using the syntax "attributeName='attributeValue'", where attributeName is the name of the attribute and attributeValue is the value assigned to it.
### property
- A "property", **refers to a value** that is assigned to an element's attribute. -
- Properties are used to set and retrieve values of an element's attributes using JavaScript. 
- Properties are accessed from DOM (Document Object Model) nodes.
- For example, the "src" attribute of an image element can be accessed and changed using the "src" property of the JavaScript object representing the image element.
### Summary
- In summary, an "attribute" is part of the HTML code used to define an element's properties, while a "property" is a value assigned to that attribute that can be accessed and manipulated through JavaScript.
