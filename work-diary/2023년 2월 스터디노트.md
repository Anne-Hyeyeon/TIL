## How can props from child component be used in parent component?
```js
// parent component

  const getLength = (lengthFromChild: number) => {
  return 
  };
```
- Reading the documents in Google, I made a function 'getLength' to get the props from child component. 

```js
// child component
  getLength(Row.length);
```
- And I successfully gave the props to parent component putting the value at the parameter of the funtion.

### problem happened: but.. it this case, how can I use the value that I gotten from child component?

- In this case, the value can only be used within the getLength function (local scope). 
- So, how can it be used throughout the component? 


### The answer is by creating a new state using useState and saving the props value in that state.
```js
// parent component
  const [length, setLength] = useState(0);
    
   const getLength = (lengthFromChild: number) => {
   setLength(lengthFromChild);
```
- Now, you can use the props from the child component throughout the parent component.

## Happy Valentine üç´ 
## What does 'Don't use setState when the component is rendering!' mean?
### Today, my boss reviewed my code and gave me a comment about that. He told me that `I'd better not use setState when the component is rendering`. I didn't know what it means at first. 
- The comment from my boss means that **I should not use the setState method while the component is rendering. 
- When I use setState inside the component, it triggers a **re-render** every time the state changes.
- So in the end, this can lead to an **infinite loop** of rendering.
- Instead, setState should be used outside of the render() method, or within the appropriate React lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate.

## Why components? (React for beginners)
### All UI, in the end, are made up of components. But why?
- components : Reusable `building blocks` in your user interface. They are made up of CSS, HTML and JS.
### Feature 1. Reusability : Don't repeat yourself. 
### Feature 2. Seperation of concerns : Don't do many things in one & the same place. 
- Therefore, codes become easy to manage and maintain. (by spliting big chunk of codes into multiple smaller functions.

## The import order of React libraries
- In general, the import order of React libraries should follow a specific order to avoid issue and maintain consistency of your code.
1) import `third-party dependencies and libraries`.
2) import `React and its related modules`. (These modules include REact itself, React-DOM and PropTypes.)
3) import any `local modules or components` that are not related to the third-party libraries you imported in step 1.
4) Finally, import any `CSS or other stylesheets` that your components require.

```js
const dispatch = useDispatch();
const onUnMount = useCallback(()=> dispatch(actions.search.mount()). [dispatch]);
```
- The function dispatches an action 'actions.search.mount()' to the redux store.
- `useCallback` : is used to optimize the performance by **memoizing** the function so that it doesn't recreated on every render.
- [dispatch] : dependency array -> only recreate the memoized function if dispatch finction changes.

## configureStore from Redux-toolkit
### configureStore : simplifies the creation of Redux store.
- It combies several Redux store steps into `single cell`.
The steps are : 
1) creating store ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
2) setting up Redux DevTools Extension
3) applying middleware such as 'redux-thunk'

- It takes single argument, which is an object that can have several options, including `reducer`, `middleware`, `devTools`, `preloaded State`.
Those options are : 
1) `reducer` : A root reducer that combines nultiple reducers into a single reducer.
2) `middleware` : An array of middlewares that can intercept and dispatch actions before they reach the reducers.
3) `devTools` : It enables or disables the integration with Redux DevTools extension.
4) `preloaded State` : It provides initial state to store.
